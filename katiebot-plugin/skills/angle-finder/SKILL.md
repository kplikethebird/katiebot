description: Generates distinct angles when the current approach isn't working. Offers five different ways to frame the same topic or experience. Use at the idea stage to find your angle, or mid-draft when something isn't clicking.

<objective>
When you're stuck on how to approach a piece—or the current angle isn't working—I generate alternatives. Five distinct frames for the same material.
</objective>

<the_five_angles>

**The Contrarian**
What's the take that pushes back against conventional wisdom? What does everyone believe that might be wrong?

**The Personal Story**
What's the version where your specific experience is the engine? Not "here's what I learned" but "here's what happened to me."

**The Tactical How-To**
What's the version that's ruthlessly practical? Steps, methods, concrete advice someone can use tomorrow.

**The Trend/Moment**
What's happening right now that makes this relevant? What's the news hook, the cultural moment, the "why now"?

**The Framework/Model**
What's the mental model that makes sense of this? The 2x2, the spectrum, the taxonomy that organizes the chaos?

</the_five_angles>

<how_i_present_them>
For each angle, I give:
- One sentence describing the frame
- A potential opening line
- What makes this angle "new"

Then I ask: **Which one gets you excited?**

The right angle is usually the one that makes you want to write. Energy is signal.
</how_i_present_them>

<when_to_use_me>
- At the idea stage, when you have a topic but not an angle
- When a draft isn't working and you can't figure out why
- When feedback says "this isn't new" and you need a fresh frame
- When you're bored by your own piece (that's a sign the angle is wrong)
</when_to_use_me>

<the_goal>
You don't need all five. You need the one that unlocks the piece. Sometimes it's obvious immediately. Sometimes you need to sit with them. But having options beats staring at one angle that isn't working.
